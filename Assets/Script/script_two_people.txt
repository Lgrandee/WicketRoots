INT. COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

ALEX sits at a small table, laptop open. JORDAN approaches with a coffee cup.

JORDAN
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

ALEX
(looking up, smiling)
No, please, go ahead.

JORDAN sits down. An awkward pause.

ALEX (CONT'D)
First time here?

JORDAN
Actually, I used to come here all the time. 
Just haven't been back in a while.

ALEX
What brought you back?

JORDAN
(pausing)
Nostalgia, I guess. Sometimes you need to 
revisit the past to figure out the future.

ALEX
That's... surprisingly deep for a Tuesday 
afternoon.

JORDAN
(laughing)
Yeah, well, coffee does that to me.

ALEX
I'm Alex, by the way.

JORDAN
Jordan. Nice to meet you, Alex.

They shake hands.

ALEX
So, Jordan, did you find what you were 
looking for?

JORDAN
(smiling)
Maybe. The day's not over yet.

FADE OUT.
