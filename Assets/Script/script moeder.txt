MATILDA: Hi, mom.

MOM: Hi, Tilly. Thank you so much for wanting to arrange our anniversary. It means a lot to me and your father.

MATILDA: Yeah, no worries. I just hope I don't exceed your expectations.

MOM: Hahaha, I'm pretty sure you will! We're in great hands when it comes to our little baby girl.

MATILDA: Mooooom…

MOM: I’m joking. Love you.

MATILDA: Love you too.
