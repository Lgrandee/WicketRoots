Long, long ago… In a town named Crestwood… There was a vampire and a witch who found each other, fell in love and got married- laugh Fuck this fairytale shit.


My name’s Matilda Scott. My mom is a witch, my dad a vampire. So that makes me half a witch and… half a vamp. I’m not very old, just 23. But my parents are like a million.


Anywho, I’ve been living in Crestwood. I met horrible and very great people. Like my boyfriend! Who… is both. He’s a dick, but a funny dick, one I unfortunately fell for. Kidding. I love him.


Today’s my parent’s 100th anniversary, so they asked me if I could help them rearrange a fun little get together, just the two of them. Unfortunately for that, I have to go through hell and back to find all the decorations.


Okay, you’re all caught up with my story! Let’s find these decorations and make my happily married parents even more happy.
